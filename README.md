# Berkeley Deep Drive-X (eXplanation) Dataset

We focus on generating textual descriptions and explanations, such as the pair:<br />
*“Vehicle slows down”* (description) and *“Because it is approaching an intersection and the light is red”* (explanation)

### How we collect?
Our explanation dataset is built on top of Berkeley Deep Drive dataset (<https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/>) collected from dashboard cameras in human driven vehicles. Annotators view the video dataset, compose descriptions of the vehicle’s activity and explanations for the actions that the vehicle driver performed.
